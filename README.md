# Icy

Basically just a fork of https://github.com/iced-rs/iced

Which is IMHO a very good UI library that just need some core things changed to be perfect:

+ Mouse event handling with modifiers 
+ Clipboard handling that works and isn't just a lackluster
+ Scrollbar that's not from 1998 and works on long view areas as well
+ Menus 
+ Extended theming
- Basic support for focus/keyboard input for all controls
- Drag & drop support

Unfortunately iced isn't moving and/or unwilling to move forward. So I was forced to fork it.

I don't intend to break much away from iced to be able to port/take upstream changes.
Icy is just ment to be used by my own tool suite for now.

Which has very specific needs. Best is to stay with iced or libcosmic for now. I don't have an idea
where this is going to but I need more out of an UI lib than what the existing ones deliver.

However you can take a look and if you have similiar needs feel free to use this fork instead.

I try to keep doc up 2 date.
